            <p>Some issues along my path are the reasonably high crime and addiction rates, semi-low employment rates and a low median income.  These problems arise because of the social housing area at the start of my route.  In the years 2013-2016 there were a total of 472 calls responded to by the police.  While 80 of them were for minor offences such as graffiti, the rest (390) were for more serious crimes such as assault, burglaries and drugs.  There was also one shooting in 2016 (one injured, no deaths).  These issues are not the worst seen in Ottawa but they are still issues we need to combat.  One way to solve some of these issues would be to help people improve their situation so that they can move out of social housing.  This would both aid the government by creating new spots within the social housing and aid the residents by helping them become more productive members of society.

            <p>Along the route I took I passed two reasonably different demographic areas.  The first is Upper-Blackburn, where I live.  In this area there is a 60% employment rate and a median household income of $156,000.  This is possibly due to the difference in age in these two areas with the median age in Upper-Blackburn being 48 and in Lower-Blackburn only 36.  This difference may have lead to people in Upper-Blackburn having higer ranking positions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g">
            <p>The other area, Lower Blackburn, has an 86% employment rate but a median household income of $88,000.  Another possibility for the wage discrepancy is the difference in education.  In Upper-Blackburn 66% of adults have a university degree and only 5.9% have no certification.  In Lower-Blackburn however, just 24.6% of adults have a university degree and 9.9% have no certification</p>

                This seems to indicate that these two different areas are comprised of people who hold different jobs.  Namely, people in Upper-Blackburn hold jobs mainly in the government (30%), sciences (18%) and management (18%). </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">In Lower-Blackburn however, most people work in business (30%), sales(10%), trades(10%), government(10%) and sciences(10%).</p>
