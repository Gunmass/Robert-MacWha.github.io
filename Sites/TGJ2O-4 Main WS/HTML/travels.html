                <h3>London, England</h3>
                <p>I went to London in 2019, over march break.  Just me and my father, of on a grand adventure.  Iâ€™ve always loved the idea of living in Londen and there I was, going to see my favorite city for the first time.  During my time in the city I got to go to almost every place I had seen or heard of in popular media such as the London spire, the Sherlock Holmes pub, Buckingham Palace and their Art museum with the Rosetta stone.  Perhaps the best part of the trip, however, was simply taking the tube to a random part of the city and walking around, exploring.  Living in ottawa for most of my life I have never seen a city as large or intricate as London.  Places similar to the downtown farmers market were simply casually strewn about with no need for incentives from the government.  All in all, it was an amazing experience and I would eagerly hop at the opportunity to go once more.
