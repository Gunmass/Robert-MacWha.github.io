            <p>The periodic table, also known as the <b>periodic table of elements</b>, is a tabular display of the chemical elements, which are arranged by <i>atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties</i>. The structure of the table shows periodic trends. The seven rows of the table, called <b>periods</b>, generally have <i>metals on the left and non-metals on the right</i>. The columns, called <b>groups</b>, <i>contain elements with similar chemical behaviours</i>. Six groups have accepted names as well as assigned numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the <b>halogens</b>; and group 18 are the <b>noble gases</b>. Also displayed are four simple rectangular areas or blocks associated with the filling of different atomic orbitals.</p>

            <p>The elements from atomic numbers 1 <i>(hydrogen)</i> through 118 <i>(oganesson)</i> have been <b>discovered or synthesized</b>, completing seven full rows of the periodic table. <i>The first 94 elements all occur naturally</i>, though some are found only in trace amounts and a few were discovered in nature only after having first been synthesized. <i>Elements 95 to 118 have only been synthesized</i> in laboratories or nuclear reactors. The synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is currently being pursued: these elements would <b>begin an eighth row</b>, and theoretical work has been done to suggest possible candidates for this extension. Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories.</p>

            <p>The <b>organization</b> of the periodic table can be used to <i>derive relationships between the various element properties</i>, and also to predict chemical properties and behaviours of undiscovered or newly synthesized elements. Russian chemist <b>Dmitri Mendeleev</b> published the <i>first recognizable periodic table in 1869</i>, developed mainly to illustrate <b>periodic trends</b> of the then-known elements. <i>He also predicted some properties of unidentified elements</i> that were expected to fill gaps within the table. Most of his forecasts proved to be correct. Mendeleev's idea has been slowly expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behaviour. The <b>modern periodic table</b> now provides a useful framework for <i>analyzing chemical reactions</i>, and continues to be widely used in chemistry, nuclear physics and other sciences.</p>
