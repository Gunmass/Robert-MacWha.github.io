                <h3>Info on the ride [Materials]</h3>
                <p>This  monument was built with the use of hundreds of popsicle sticks [4$], Grease[2], Motors[1], 
                    Wheels[4] and many Rubber Bands[~20].  The contraption is built to run on solar power due both the 
                    quantity of solar energy around us and because it produces the power in a much simpler manner.  
                    The solar panel (Located outside the ride) supplies power to our motor that turns a lift to bring 
                    the cars to the top of the Coaster.  </p>

                <h3>Construction</h3>
                <p>During the process of construction, many problems were encountered.  When building the initial
                    incline we faced issues in the sense of the height of the base. We were having trouble figuring
                    out how high it needed to be in order for it to run smoothly during the turn which follows. We
                    eventually reached the conclusion of making the base 24.5 inches tall. When thinking about the 
                    turn we had trouble figuring out if the power from the incline would actually be enough for the 
                    car to successfully go around the turn. We eventually came to the (Incorrect) decision that with 
                    the height of the roller coaster it shouldn’t be too much of a problem.  We spent countless hours 
                    in attempt to perfect the Roller Coaster but sadly it is non-functional. We think that the overall 
                    idea and creation was very well thought out but just lacked some key elements in order for it to work. 
                    Unfortunately, the ride is not successful even though Robert, Swarnava, Daisy and I put in large 
                    amounts of work. I think that this result occurred because we didn’t ever stop to think and ask 
                    ourselves the question will this actually work? I think that to improve we could have had better
                    thought out our plans instead of just getting straight down to business and hoping for the best. We 
                    could have decided on a less complex amusement park ride such as a spinning ride because it requires
                    much less precise detail and it seems much simpler. Building an entire Roller Coaster that works with 
                    solar or wind power is a difficult thing to do in the span of one month. Despite this challenge I think
                    that my team and I did an incredible job at persevering and making it to the finished product.</p>

                    <p>This ride is located in the great city of Toronto, to the south of the main downtown area, in a well known park called Canada’s Wonder World.  This is currently our newest attraction and we hope that even though the general public seems to have grown tired of waiting for its completion they will accept it in the end and realize how incredible it is to ride.</p>
